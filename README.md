# Advent of Code 2022!

## Building
Each day is split into pt1 & pt2 with a `Makefile` meaning you should be able to run `make`, run solve and it should just work(tm).

I am leaning on some things I've built, which are in the includes folder. This needs to be build so the solutions can link against it.
```bash
cd ./includes && make
```
